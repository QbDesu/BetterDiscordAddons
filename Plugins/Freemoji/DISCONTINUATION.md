# Discontinuation

As of September 8th, 2022, the Freemoji plugin is discontinued. The plugin will not receive any further updates - if it breaks, it stays broken.

The main reason is my disappointment and disgust upon seeing the reactions and hate coming from the community following the recent guideline updates and the discontinuation of the ShowHiddenChannels plugin. The reason is not the updated guidelines but the obnoxious community.

## The Guidelines

To clarify and stop people from spreading more misinformation: The Freemoji plugin was **not** affected by these updated guidelines and would still be allowed to be an official plugin. But I no longer wish to cater to people who cry "censorship" because somebody broke their toy that allowed them to see things they weren't supposed to.

The BetterDiscord team notified developers about the updated guidelines sometime around [July 16th](https://github.com/BetterDiscord/docs/blob/3add40bdda0afbadc6c0af09d10413bbdee54f5f/src/plugins/introduction/guidelines.md). They have been in the works much earlier than that. There were discussions about banning ShowHiddenChannels for as long as that plugin existed.

To the people calling BetterDiscord hypocrites for not banning free emoji plugins, I've heard you loud and clear and removed the only working official free emoji plugin from the store. \*winky face\*

For some reason, discussions about message loggers came up surrounding these changes. However, message loggers were already banned before the update. There was never an official message logging plugin; nothing changed there.

## Annoying Maintenance

Before I get to the gritty part, some minor reasons for me not working on this plugin anymore that added up over time:

* people asking for help, completely ignoring whatever guide they came from
  * I am not the one that handles teaching people how to use BD
  * I am not the one that handles teaching people how to use their Windows PC
* having to maintain parts that I literally couldn't care less about
  * message splitting
  * typing out the names of emojis - I always use the emoji picker
* it's no fun to develop and takes away the motivation for other plugins
* I originally made the plugin for a friend who would have otherwise resorted to unofficial plugins - said friend has nitro now
  * The first iteration was a fork of NitroPerks
  * I later rewrote it to be a fork of DiscordFreeEmojis with some features inspired by NitroPerks and some new ones on top

However, I want to thank GitHub user FrostBird347 for his recent contributions to the plugin. They were and still are very appreciated.

## ShowHiddenChannels

I support entirely the BetterDiscord team and the updated guidelines that ban ShowHiddenChannels. I don't condemn DevilBro's handling of the update. Aside from DevilBro applying the update without user interaction, the mechanism he used has since been removed from BDFDB and will not happen again.

Updating the BDFDB data file to remove the unused entries that ShowHiddenChannels previously used is also completely understandable. I would probably have done the same. Calling the way he handled the update malicious is nonsense. It didn't harm the user, and users are not entitled to have the plugin continue functioning. Malice would be stealing the user's account or bricking their system.

## The Tinfoil Hats

The recent events revealed a lot of creeps and tinfoil hats that validate that banning ShowHiddenChannels was a good thing. People who threatened developers, and harassed BD staff, were generally insulting, all that while thinking of themselves as the reasonable heroes unfairly censored by BetterDiscord. These guys aren't heroes; they are creeps that should get a life and stop being assholes.

Some rumor circulated about somebody named "keffels" being behind all this, and this all being a big conspiracy with them pulling the strings... Only that no one in the community had heard of them before that rumor. ~~Apparently, they are partly responsible for taking down a forum known for doxxing, harassing, and even driving people into suicide. I should probably check him out at some point.~~ (Edit: Scratch that last part, it looks like they aren't such a great person after all.)

## Reddit

Also, just a bit of a Reddit sidenote: **There is no official BetterDiscord subreddit.** A single person runs the r/BetterDiscord subreddit with no connection to the BetterDiscord project. The person running it doesn't like people saying that and linking to the official Discord server. This person doesn't hesitate to ban people connected to BD when they say things he doesn't like, such as linking to the official channels.

The only official BetterDiscord channels are:

* [the website](https://betterdiscord.app/)
* [the Discord servers](https://discord.gg/0Tmfo5ZbORCRqbAd)
* [the Twitter Account](https://twitter.com/_BetterDiscord_)
* and [the GitHub Organization](https://github.com/BetterDiscord)

## PS.

I completely forgot that EmoteReplacer exists. It's a well-made official plugin and a free emoji plugin, even if it works differently from Freemoji. But I like the sass in the paragraph about BetterDiscord's supposed hypocrisy, so I'll leave it unchanged.
