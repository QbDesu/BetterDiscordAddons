# Discontinuation

As of September 8th, 2022 the Freemoji plugin is discontinued. The plugin will not receive any further updates - if it breaks it stays broken.

The main reason for that is my disappointment and disgust upon seeing some of the reactions and hate coming from the community following the recent guideline updates and the discontinuation of the ShowHiddenChannels plugin. The reason is not the updated guidelines, but the obnoxious community.

## The Guidelines

To clarify, and stop people from spreading more misinformation: The Freemoji plugin was **not** affected by these updated guidelines, and would still be allowed to be an official plugin. But I no longer wish to cater to people who cry "censorship" because somebody broke their toy that allowed them to see things they weren't supposed to.

Developers were notified about the updated guidelines as early as [July 16th](https://github.com/BetterDiscord/docs/blob/3add40bdda0afbadc6c0af09d10413bbdee54f5f/src/plugins/introduction/guidelines.md). They have been in the works much earlier than that, and there were discussions about banning ShowHiddenChannels since pretty much as long as that plugin existed.

To the people calling BetterDiscord hypocrites for not banning free emoji plugins, I've heard you loud and clear and removed the only working official free emoji plugin from the store. \*winky face\*

For some reason, discussions about message loggers came up surrounding these changes. Message loggers were already banned before the update. There was never an official message logging plugin, nothing changed there.

## Annoying Maintenance

Before I get to the gritty part, some minor reasons for me not working on this plugin anymore that added up over time:

* people asking for help, completely ignoring whatever guide they came from
  * it's not my job to teach people how to use BD
  * it's not my job to teach people how to use their Windows PC
* having to maintain parts that I litterally couldn't care less about
  * message splitting
  * typing out the names of emoji - I always use the emoji picker
* it's no fun to develop and takes away motivation for other plugins
* I originally made the plugin for a friend who would have otherwise resorted to unofficial plugins - said friend has nitro now
  * the first itteration was a fork of NitroPerks
  * I later rewrote it to be a fork of DiscordFreeEmojis with some features inspired by NitroPerks and some new ones on top

I'd like to thank GitHub user FrostBird347 for his recent contributions to the plugin though. They were and still are very appreciated.

## ShowHiddenChannels

I'm in complete support of the BetterDiscord team and the updated guidelines that ban ShowHiddenChannels. I don't condemn the way DevilBro handled the update, aside from the part where the update was applied without user interaction, the mechanism that did that has since been removed from BDFDB and will not happen again.

Updating the BDFDB data file to remove the then unused entries that were previously used by ShowHiddenChannels is also completely understandle, and I would probably have done the same. Calling the way he handled the update malicious is nonsense. It didn't do any harm to the user, users aren't entitled to have the plugin continue functioning, malice would be stealing the users account, or bricking their system.

## The Tinfoil Hats

The recent events revealed a lot of creeps and tinfoil hats that absolutely validate that banning ShowHiddenChannels was a good thing. People who threatened developers, harassed BD staff, were generally insulting, all that while thinking of themselves as the reasonable heroes that were unfairly censored by BetterDiscord. These guys aren't heroes, they are creeps that should really get a life and stop being assholes.

Some rumor circulated about somebody named "keffels" being behind all this, and this all being a big conspiracy with them pulling the strings.... Only that no one in the community ever heard of them before that rumor. Apparently, they are in part responsible for taking down a forum known for doxxing, harassing, and even driving people into suicide, so I should probably check him out at some point.

## Reddit

Also just as a bit of a Reddit sidenote. **There is no official BetterDiscord subreddit.** The r/BetterDiscord subreddit is run by a single person who is not connected to the BetterDiscord project. The person running it doesn't like people saying that and linking to the official Discord server. This person doesn't hesitate to ban people who are actually connected to BD when they say things he doesn't like such as linking to the official channels.

The only official BetterDiscord channels are:

* [the website](https://betterdiscord.app/)
* [the Discord servers](https://discord.gg/0Tmfo5ZbORCRqbAd)
* [the Twitter Account](https://twitter.com/_BetterDiscord_)
* and [the GitHub Organization](https://github.com/BetterDiscord)
