# Freemoji - Discontinued

**This plugin is discontinued as of September 8th, 2022.**

Using this plugin you can send emoji from other server and animated emotes without having Nitro. This works by automatically replacing selected emoji with a corresponding image link.

It even works for animated emoji. Because it's sending an image link it won't work mid-sentence or for sending multiple emoji at once. But for single emote messages it's pretty much seamless.

This plugin is adapted from FreeEmojis by [An00nymushun](https://github.com/An00nymushun). It adds a number of options so you can configure it as you see fit. You can change the size of the sent emoji, and it enables you to send emoji that FreeEmojis can't.
